## The Third Pacific Advanced Fisheries Economics Workshop

Funded by <img src=https://github.com/fdd-eiu/afew/blob/main/rogoblue3.png width = 50 nehigh= 100>

## June 5-8 2023

Note due to a public Holiday in the Solomons we have had to shorten the workshop by one day.

This is the third in a series of Advanced workshops ([First workshop](https://github.com/fdd-eiu/afew), [Second workshop](https://github.com/fdd-eiu/afew/blob/main/refresher.md)), the first was held in 2021, the materials can be found on the main [Afew](https://github.com/fdd-eiu/afew) page. The second workshop was a refresher workshop held in early 2022 which reviewed material from our introductory workshop and material from the advanced workshop. The economics of fisheries licensing workshop will build on these and focus on the use of bio-economic models for licensing in regulated and restricted open-access fisheries and in particular focus on the economics of the relationship between coastal states and distant water fishing fleets. We will also touch on approaches to the economics of fisheries allocations using allocation rules and claims rules and questions of fair division.

Breaks for morning (11:00am) and afternoon tea (3:30pm) and lunch (12:30pm) will occur

Software set-up:

We will be using Jupyter notebooks and Python.

The first-step is to click on the link at right and install if you haven't already done so [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

**You will need administrator rights on your computer to do this**.

Also have a look at [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (you will need a [gmail account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) to access this).

Exercise access will be enabled prior to the workshop.
